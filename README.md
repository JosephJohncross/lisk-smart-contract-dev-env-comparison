# Smart Contract Dev Environments: Hardhat vs Foundry, and Remix vs Local IDEs

## Introduction

Choosing the right development environment for smart contracts is essential. Different tools offer different advantages depending on your needs, the size of your project, and your preferred programming style. In this document, we'll objectively compare Hardhat and Foundry when it comes to building, compiling, and deploying smart contracts. We'll also highlight the differences between using a local IDE like Visual Studio Code versus using Remix.

## Hardhat vs Foundry

| Feature | Hardhat | Foundry |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Primary Language** | JavaScript/TypeScript | Solidity (for tests too) |
| **Compilation** | `npx hardhat compile` (moderate speed) | `forge build` (very fast) |
| **Testing** | JavaScript/TypeScript with Mocha/Chai | Pure Solidity with Forge framework |
| **Deployment** | Scripts written in JavaScript/TypeScript | Scripts written in Solidity (`forge script`) |
| **Setup** | Requires Node.js and npm packages | One-line installation (`foundryup`) |
| **Plugins** | Rich ecosystem (e.g., gas reporters, etherscan verification) | Fewer plugins but fast and built-in verification |
| **Gas Reporting** | Needs plugin like `hardhat-gas-reporter` | Built-in by default |
| **Speed** | Slower compared to Foundry for large projects | Extremely fast (optimized for performance) |
| **Learning Curve** | Easier for web developers | More suited for Solidity developers |
| **Best Use Case** | Complex deployments, projects needing external integrations | High-performance testing, pure Solidity projects |

### Key Points to Learn

- Hardhat is flexible and great if you're familiar with JavaScript.
- Foundry is better if you want faster testing and deployment directly in Solidity.

## Building Smart Contracts in Local IDEs vs Remix

| Feature | Local IDE (VSCode, etc.) | Remix IDE (Browser) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Setup** | Requires manual setup (Node.js, Hardhat, Foundry, plugins) | No setup needed; browser-based |
| **Compilation** | Use CLI commands like `npx hardhat compile` or `forge build` | One-click compilation |
| **Deployment** | Use CLI commands (Hardhat: `npx hardhat run`, Foundry: `forge create`) | Easy in-browser deployment UI |
| **Version Control** | Full Git/GitHub integration | Must manually download/upload files |
| **Plugin Availability** | Extensive (Solhint, Prettier, GitLens, etc.) | Limited to Remix plugins only |
| **Control** | Full control over project structure, dependencies, custom tools | Limited control, good for prototypes |
| **Best For** | Professional, production-ready projects | Quick testing, learning, and tutorials |

### Key Points to Learn

- Local IDEs give you full control, scalability, and are necessary for real-world projects.
- Remix is ideal for fast prototyping, small experiments, and learning Solidity.

## Conclusion

- If you're familiar with JavaScript/TypeScript and need flexibility and plugins, **use Hardhat**.
- If you want speed and native Solidity workflows, **use Foundry**.
- For serious, production-level work with version control and team collaboration, **use a local IDE** like VSCode.
- For learning, quick prototyping, or small experiments, **use Remix**.

Both Hardhat and Foundry are powerful, but they target slightly different developer experiences. Similarly, Remix is a fantastic learning tool but not a replacement for professional local development setups.

## Notes

- Learn the tool that best matches your project scale and your preferred workflow.
- Always version control your smart contracts when working in a professional setting.
